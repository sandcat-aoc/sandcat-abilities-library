- description: 'Stops a specified service by sending a SIGTERM signal to the linked
    process using pkill. This method is effective when multiple instances of the process
    may be running.

    Upon execution, if any instances of the process were running, they will be terminated.
    If no instances were running, pkill will not find any processes to kill.

    Stopped service can be restarted by running the cleanup command.

    You can list all available services with following command: "systemctl list-units
    --type=service"
