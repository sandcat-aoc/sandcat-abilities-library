    \ However, it can also be used to run processes as the local system account.\n\
    \nThe local system account is a default windows account which has unrestricted\
    \ access to all system resources.\n\nUpon successful execution, PsExec.exe will\
    \ spawn a command prompt which will run 'whoami' as the local system account and\
    \ then exit.    \n"
