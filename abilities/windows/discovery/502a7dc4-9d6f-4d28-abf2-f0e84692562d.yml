  name: Detect Virtualization Environment (Windows)
  description: Windows Management Instrumentation(WMI) objects contains system information
    which helps to detect virtualization. This command will specifically attempt to
    get the CurrentTemperature value from this object and will check to see if the
    attempt results in an error that contains the word supported. This is meant to
    find the result of Not supported, which is the result if run in a virtual machine
