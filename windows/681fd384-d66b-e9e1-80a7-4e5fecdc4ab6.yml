- description: "This test is a Powershell script that enumerates Active Directory\
    \ to determine computers that are joined to the domain. \nThis test is designed\
    \ to mimic how SessionGopher can determine the additional systems within a domain,\
    \ which has been used before by threat actors to aid in lateral movement. \nReference:\
    \ [Head Fake: Tackling Disruptive Ransomware Attacks](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks).\
    \ \nUpon successful execution, this test will output the names of the computers\
    \ that reside on the domain to the console window. \n"
