- description: "Creates a process in a suspended state and calls QueueUserAPC WinAPI\
    \ to add a UserAPC to the child process that points to allocated shellcode. \n\
    ResumeThread is called which then calls NtTestAlert to execute the created UserAPC\
    \ which then executes the shellcode.\nThis technique allows for the early execution\
    \ of shellcode and potentially before AV/EDR can hook functions to support detection.\n\
