  name: textutil - Use the textutil to read several files and build a new file
  description: A one-liner can load the content of multiple RTF files in a directory, concatenate their
    contents, and write the results out as a new file. This provides two sub-use-cases; one is building
    a malicious file from a collection of smaller files which could evade both network and host-based
    security controls as the traditional means of signature-based detection would be redundant; two is
    concatenating the content of several, potentially sensitive files before exfiltration. This command
    can also be looped to iterate a directory of files.
