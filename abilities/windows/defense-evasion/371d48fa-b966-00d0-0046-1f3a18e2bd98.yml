  name: Query.exe - Once executed, `query.exe` will execute `quser.exe` in the same
    folder. Thus, if `query.exe` is copied to a folder and an arbitrary executable
    is renamed to `quser.exe`, `query.exe` will spawn it. Instead of `user`, it is
    also possible to use `session`, `termsession` or `process` as command-line option.
