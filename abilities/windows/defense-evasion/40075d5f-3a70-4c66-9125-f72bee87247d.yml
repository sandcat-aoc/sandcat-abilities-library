  name: Windows Disable LSA Protection
  description: 'The following Atomic adds a registry entry to disable LSA Protection.


    The LSA controls and manages user rights information, password hashes and other
    important bits of information in memory. Attacker tools, such as mimikatz, rely
    on accessing this content to scrape password hashes or clear-text passwords. Enabling
    LSA Protection configures Windows to control the information stored in memory
    in a more secure fashion - specifically, to prevent non-protected processes from
    accessing that data.

    Upon successful execution, the registry will be modified and RunAsPPL will be
    set to 0, disabling Lsass protection.
