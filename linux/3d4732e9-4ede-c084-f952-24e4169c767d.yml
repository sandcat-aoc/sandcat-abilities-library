- description: 'This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment
    variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the
    exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.


    Upon successful execution, bash will utilize LD_PRELOAD to load the shared object
    library `/etc/ld.so.preload`. Output will be via stdout.
