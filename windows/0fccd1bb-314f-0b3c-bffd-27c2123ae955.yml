- description: 'This test simulates an infected host sending a large volume of DNS
    queries to a command and control server.

    The intent of this test is to trigger threshold based detection on the number
    of DNS queries either from a single source system or to a single targe domain.

    A custom domain and sub-domain will need to be passed as input parameters for
    this test to work. Upon execution, DNS information about the domain will be displayed
    for each callout.
