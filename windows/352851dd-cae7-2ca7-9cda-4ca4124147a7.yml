- description: "WevtUtil is a command line tool that can be utilised by adversaries\
    \ to gather intelligence on a targeted Windows system's logging infrastructure.\
    \ \n\nBy executing this command, malicious actors can enumerate all available\
    \ event logs, including both default logs such as Application, Security, and System\n\
    as well as any custom logs created by administrators. \n\nThis information provides\
    \ valuable insight into the system's logging mechanisms, potentially allowing\
    \ attackers to identify gaps or weaknesses in the logging configuration"
