- description: 'Using ''auditctl -D'' deletes all existing audit rules, resulting
    in the loss of previously configured monitoring settings and the audit trail.
    This action reduces visibility into system activities, potentially leading to
    compliance concerns and hampering security monitoring efforts. Additionally, it
    poses a risk of covering unauthorized activities by erasing evidence from audit
    logs.
