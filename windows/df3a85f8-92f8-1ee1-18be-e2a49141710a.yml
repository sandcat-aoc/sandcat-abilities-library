- description: 'This test is intended to be run on a domain Controller.


    The Active Directory database NTDS.dit may be dumped using NTDSUtil for offline
    credential theft attacks. This capability

    uses the "IFM" or "Install From Media" backup functionality that allows Active
    Directory restoration or installation of

    subsequent domain controllers without the need of network-based replication.


    Upon successful completion, you will find a copy of the ntds.dit file in the C:\Windows\Temp
    directory.
