- description: 'An adversary may develop a useful utility or subvert the CI/CD pipe
    line of a legitimate utility developer, who requires or suggests installing their
    utility by piping a curl download directly into bash. Of-course this is a very
    bad idea. The adversary may also take advantage of this BLIND install method and
    selectively running extra commands in the install script for those who DO pipe
    to bash and not for those who DO NOT. This test uses curl to download the pipe-to-shell.sh
    script, the first time without piping it to bash and the second piping it into
    bash which executes the echo command.
