  name: textutil - Capture clipboard content
  description: By leveraging another command line tool, pbpaste, it is possible to write a one-liner which
    captures the content of the clipboard. If an attacker already has access to the system, the attacker
    could run this command to obtain sensitive information such as a password and then elevate their privileges
    or exfiltrate the information.
