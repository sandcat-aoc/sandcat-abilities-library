  name: Block Cybersecurity communication by leveraging Windows Name Resolution Policy
    Table
  description: Adversaries are redirecting DNS queries to an incorrect or malicious
    DNS server IP, thereby blocking legitimate communications and potentially compromising
    the security infrastructure. This atomic test aims to respond with 127.0.0.1 when
    a DNS query is made for endpoint.security.microsoft.com.
