  name: Change.exe - Once executed, `change.exe` will execute `chgusr.exe` in the
    same folder. Thus, if `change.exe` is copied to a folder and an arbitrary executable
    is renamed to `chgusr.exe`, `change.exe` will spawn it. Instead of `user`, it
    is also possible to use `port` or `logon` as command-line option.
