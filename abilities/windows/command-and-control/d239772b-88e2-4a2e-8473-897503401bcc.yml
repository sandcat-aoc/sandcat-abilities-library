  description: "Uses the cmdl32 to download arbitrary file from the internet. The\
    \ cmdl32 package is allowed to install the profile used to launch the VPN connection.\
    \ However, the config is modified to download the arbitary file. \nThe issue of\
    \ cmdl32.exe detecting and deleting the payload by identifying it as not a VPN\
    \ Servers profile is avoided by setting a temporary TMP folder and denying the\
    \ delete permission to all files for the user.\nUpon successful execution the\
    \ test will open calculator and Notepad executable for 10 seconds.\nreference:\n\
