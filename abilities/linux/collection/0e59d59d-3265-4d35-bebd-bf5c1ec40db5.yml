  name: Logging bash history to syslog
  description: 'There are several variables that can be set to control the appearance
    of the bash command prompt: PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PROMPT_COMMAND. The contents
    of these variables are executed as if they had been typed on the command line.
    The PROMPT_COMMAND variable "if set" will be executed before the PS1 variable
    and can be configured to write the latest "bash history" entries to the syslog.


    To gain persistence the command could be added to the users .bashrc or .bash_aliases
    or the systems default .bashrc in /etc/skel/'
