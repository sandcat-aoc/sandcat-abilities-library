- description: The reg query commands allows to check the status of the AlwaysInstallElevated
    registry key for both the user and the machine. If both queries return a value
    of 0x1, then AlwaysInstallElevated is enabled for both user and machine thus allowing
    a regular user to install a Microsoft Windows Installer package with system level
    privileges. This can be abused by an attacker to escalate privileges in the host
    to SYSTEM level.
