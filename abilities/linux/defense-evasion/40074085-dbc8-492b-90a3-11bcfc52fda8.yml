  name: Tamper with Defender ATP on Linux/MacOS
  description: 'With root privileges, an adversary can disable real time protection.
    Note, this test assumes Defender is not in passive mode and real-time protection
    is enabled. The use of a managed.json on Linux or Defender .plist on MacOS will
    prevent these changes. Tamper protection will also prevent this (available on
    MacOS, but not Linux at the time of writing). Installation of MDATP is a prerequisite.
    Installation steps vary across MacOS and Linux distros. See Microsoft public documentation
