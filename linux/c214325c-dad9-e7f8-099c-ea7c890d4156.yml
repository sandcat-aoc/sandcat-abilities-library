- description: "This test adds a shared library to the `ld.so.preload` list to execute\
    \ and intercept API calls. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during\
    \ the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.\n\n\
    Upon successful execution, bash will echo `../bin/T1574.006.so` to /etc/ld.so.preload.\
