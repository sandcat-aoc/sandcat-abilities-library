- description: "When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and\
    \ isn\u2019t enclosed within quotes, leads to a vulnerability\nknown as Unquoted\
    \ Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.\nIn this case, if\
    \ an executable program.exe in C:\\ exists, C:\\program.exe will be executed instead\
    \ of test.exe in C:\\Program Files\\subfolder\\test.exe.\n"
