  name: Execute a Command as a Service
  description: "Creates a service specifying an arbitrary command and executes it.\
    \ When executing commands such as PowerShell, the service will report that it\
    \ did not start correctly even when code executes properly.\n\nUpon successful\
    \ execution, cmd.exe creates a new service using sc.exe that will start powershell.exe\
    \ to create a new file `art-marker.txt`\n\n[BlackCat Ransomware (ALPHV)](https://www.varonis.com/blog/blackcat-ransomware)\
