  name: Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet
  description: "In Windows operating systems, command line auditing is controlled\
    \ through the following registry value:\n\n  Registry Path: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\\
    Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\Audit\n  \n  Registry Value: ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled\n\
    \nWhen command line auditing is enabled, the system records detailed information\
    \ about command execution, including the command executed, the user account responsible\
    \ for executing the command, and the timestamp of the execution.\nThis information\
    \ is crucial for security monitoring and forensic analysis, as it helps organizations\
    \ detect and investigate unauthorized or malicious activities within their systems.\n\
    By default, command line auditing may not be enabled in Windows systems, and administrators\
    \ must manually configure the appropriate registry settings to activate it.\n\
    Conversely, attackers may attempt to tamper with these registry keys to disable\
    \ command line auditing, as part of their efforts to evade detection and cover\
    \ their tracks while perpetrating malicious activities.\n\nBecause this attack\
    \ runs a Powershell cmdlet, this attack can be detected by monitoring both:\n\
    \  Powershell Logging (Windows Powershell Event ID 400, 800, 4103, 4104)\n  Registry\
    \ events (Windows Event ID 4657, Sysmon Event ID 13)\n\nRead more here:\nhttps://securitydatasets.com/notebooks/atomic/windows/defense_evasion/SDWIN-220703123711.html\n\
