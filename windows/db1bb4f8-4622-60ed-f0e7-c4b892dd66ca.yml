- description: 'This is to test for what ports are open outbound.  The technique used
    was taken from the following blog:

    https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/poking-holes-in-the-firewall-egress-testing-with-allports-exposed/


    Upon successful execution, powershell will read top-128.txt (ports) and contact
    each port to confirm if open or not. Output will be to Desktop\open-ports.txt.
