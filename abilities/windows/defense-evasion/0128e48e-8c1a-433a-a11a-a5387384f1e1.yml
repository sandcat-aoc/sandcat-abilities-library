  name: Read-Write-Execute process Injection
  description: "This test exploited the vulnerability in legitimate PE formats where\
    \ sections have RWX permission and enough space for shellcode.\nThe RWX injection\
    \ avoided the use of VirtualAlloc, WriteVirtualMemory, and ProtectVirtualMemory,\
    \ thus evading detection mechanisms \nthat relied on API call sequences and heuristics.\
    \ The RWX injection utilises API call sequences: LoadLibrary --> GetModuleInformation\
    \ --> GetModuleHandleA --> RtlCopyMemory --> CreateThread.\nThe injected shellcode\
    \ will open a message box and a notepad.\nRWX Process Injection, also known as\
    \ MockingJay, was introduced to the security community by SecurityJoes.\nMore\
    \ details can be found at https://www.securityjoes.com/post/process-mockingjay-echoing-rwx-in-userland-to-achieve-code-execution.\n\
    The original injector and idea were developed for game cheats, as visible at https://github.com/M-r-J-o-h-n/SWH-Injector."
