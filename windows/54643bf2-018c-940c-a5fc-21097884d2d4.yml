- description: 'The memory of lsass.exe is often dumped for offline credential theft
    attacks. This can be achieved with Sysinternals

    ProcDump. This particular method uses -mm to produce a mini dump of lsass.exe


    Upon successful execution, you should see the following file created c:\windows\temp\lsass_dump.dmp.


    If you see a message saying "procdump.exe is not recognized as an internal or
    external command", try using the  get-prereq_commands to download and install
    the ProcDump tool first.
