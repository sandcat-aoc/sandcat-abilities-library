  name: List macOS Firewall Rules
  description: "\"This will test if the macOS firewall is enabled and/or show what\
    \ rules are configured. Must be run with elevated privileges. Upon successful\
    \ execution, these commands will output various information about the firewall\
    \ configuration, including status and specific port/protocol blocks or allows.\
    \ \n\nUsing `defaults`, additional arguments can be added to see filtered details,\
    \ such as `globalstate` for global configuration (\\\"Is it on or off?\\\"), `firewall`\
    \ for common application allow rules, and `explicitauths` for specific rules configured\
    \ by the user. \n\nUsing `socketfilterfw`, flags such as --getglobalstate or --listapps\
    \ can be used for similar filtering. At least one flag is required to send parseable\
    \ output to standard out."
