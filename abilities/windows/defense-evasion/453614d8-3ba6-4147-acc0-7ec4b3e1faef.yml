  description: "When C# is compiled dynamically, a .cmdline file will be created as\
    \ a part of the process. \nCertain processes are not typically observed compiling\
    \ C# code, but can do so without touching disk. This can be used to unpack a payload\
    \ for execution.\nThe exe file that will be executed is named as T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe\
    \ is contained in the 'bin' folder of this atomic, and the source code to the\
    \ file is in the 'src' folder.\nUpon execution, the exe will print 'T1027.004\
    \ Dynamic Compile'."
