- description: 'Adversaries may delete TeamViewer log files to hide activity. This
    should provide a high true-positive alert ration.

    This test just places the files in a non-TeamViewer folder, a detection would
    just check for a deletion event matching the TeamViewer

    log file format of TeamViewer_##.log. Upon execution, no output will be displayed.
    Use File Explorer to verify the folder was deleted.
