  name: Identify Documents on USB and Removable Media via PowerShell
  description: "This test simulates an attack where PowerShell is used to detect connected\
    \ USB or other removable storage devices and gather a list of specific document\
    \ files \n(e.g., .docx, .xls, .txt, .pdf). The command works by first identifying\
    \ removable drives on the system and then recursively searching through each one\
    \ for files \nmatching the targeted extensions. If no removable drives are present,\
    \ the script will return a message stating that no media is detected. This behavior\
    \ mimics \nhow adversaries might scan for sensitive documents on removable devices\
    \ for exfiltration or analysis."
