- description: 'Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint


    when sucessfully executed, powershell is going to processes related AV products
    if they are running.

    Note that, depending on the privilege of current user, get-process | ?{$_.Description
    -like "*"} may not return the processes related to AV products of the check.

    For instance, only with Administrator right, you can see the process description
    of McAffee processes. Hence, it is better to use get-process | ?{$_.ProcessName
    -like "*"},

    if you know the name of those processes.
