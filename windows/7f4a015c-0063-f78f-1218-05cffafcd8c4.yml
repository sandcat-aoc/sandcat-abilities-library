- description: "This atomic test, named \"Steganographic Tarball Embedding\", simulates\
    \ the technique of data obfuscation via steganography by embedding a tar archive\
    \ file (tarball) \nwithin an image.\n\nThe test begins by ensuring the availability\
    \ of the image file and the tarball file containing data . It then generates random\
    \ passwords and saves them to a \nfile. Subsequently, the tarball file is created,\
    \ containing the passwords file. The test executor command reads the contents\
    \ of the image \nfile and the tarball file as byte arrays and appends them together\
    \ to form a new image file. This process effectively embeds the tarball \nfile\
    \ within the image, utilizing steganography techniques for data obfuscation.\n\
    \nThis atomic test simulates the technique of data obfuscation via steganography,\
    \ enabling attackers to clandestinely transfer files across systems undetected.\
    \ \nBy embedding the tarball file within the image, adversaries can obscure their\
    \ activities, facilitating covert communication and data exfiltration.\n"
