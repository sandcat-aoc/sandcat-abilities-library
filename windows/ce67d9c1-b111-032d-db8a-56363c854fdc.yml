- description: "This test used the Windows undocumented remote-fork API RtlCreateProcessReflection\
    \ to create a cloned process of the parent process\nwith shellcode written in\
    \ its memory. The shellcode is executed after being forked to the child process.\
    \ The technique was first presented at \nBlackHat Europe 2022. Shellcode will\
    \ open a messsage box and a notepad.\n"
