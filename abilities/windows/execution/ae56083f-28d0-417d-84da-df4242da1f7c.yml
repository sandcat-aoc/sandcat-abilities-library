  name: Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go
  description: 'Runs shellcode in the current running process via a syscall.


    Steps taken with this technique

    1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions
    to Read/Write

    2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space

    3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect

    4. Use syscall to execute the entrypoint of the shellcode
