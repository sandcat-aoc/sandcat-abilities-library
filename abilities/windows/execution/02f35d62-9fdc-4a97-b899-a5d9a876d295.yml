  name: Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA)
  description: The Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA) protection feature in antivirus
    software can identify and block PUAs from downloading and installing on endpoints
    in your network. These applications are not considered viruses, malware, or other
    types of threats, but might perform actions on endpoints that adversely affect
    their performance or use. This file is similar to EICAR test virus file, but is
    considered a Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) instead of a VIRUS (i.e. not
    actually malicious, but is flagged as it to verify anti-pua protection).
