  name: Reactivate a locked/expired account (FreeBSD)
  description: "A system administrator may have locked and expired a user account\
    \ rather than deleting it. \"the user is coming back, at some stage\" An adversary\
    \ may reactivate a inactive account in an attempt to appear legitimate. \n\nIn\
    \ this test we create a \"art\" user with the password art, lock and expire the\
    \ account, try to su to art and fail, unlock and renew the account, su successfully,\
    \ then delete the account."
