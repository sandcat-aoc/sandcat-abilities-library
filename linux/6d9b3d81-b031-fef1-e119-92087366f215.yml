- description: "An adversary may find themselves on a box (e.g. via ssh key auth,\
    \ with no password) with a user that has sudo'ers privileges, but they do not\
    \ know the users password. Normally, failed attempts to access root will not cause\
    \ the root account to become locked, to prevent denial-of-service. This functionality\
    \ enables an attacker to undertake a local brute force password guessing attack\
    \ without locking out the root user. \n\nThis test creates the \"art\" user with\
    \ a password of \"password123\", logs in, downloads and executes the sudo_bruteforce.sh\
    \ which brute force guesses the password, then deletes the user\n"
