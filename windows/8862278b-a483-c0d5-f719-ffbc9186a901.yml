- description: 'Attempt to change the password of the current domain user in order
    to check password policy. Ideally, you would only run this atomic test to verify
    that your password policy is blocking the use of the new password.

    If the password is succesfully changed to the new password, the credential file
    will be updated to reflect the new password.  You can then run the atomic manually
    and specify a new password of your choosing, however the

    password policy will likely prevent you from setting the password back to what
    it was.
