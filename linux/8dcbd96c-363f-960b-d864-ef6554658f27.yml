- description: 'The command `auditctl -e 0` disables the audit system. By setting
    the parameter to `0`, auditing is deactivated, halting the monitoring and recording
    of security-related events. This action stops the generation of audit logs, ceasing
    the collection of data regarding system activities. Disabling auditing may be
    done for various reasons, such as troubleshooting, performance optimization, or
    temporarily suspending auditing requirements, but it reduces visibility into system
    events and can impact security monitoring and compliance efforts.
