- description: 'This test simulates an infected host beaconing via DNS queries to
    a command and control server at regular intervals over time.

    This behaviour is typical of implants either in an idle state waiting for instructions
    or configured to use a low query volume over time to evade threshold based detection.

    A custom domain and sub-domain will need to be passed as input parameters for
    this test to work. Upon execution, DNS information about the domain will be displayed
    for each callout.
