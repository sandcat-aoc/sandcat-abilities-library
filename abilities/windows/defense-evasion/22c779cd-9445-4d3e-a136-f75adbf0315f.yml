    \ to remove all records of previously executed commands.\nThis action is often\
    \ performed by attackers to eliminate traces of their activities, making incident\
    \ detection and forensic \ninvestigation more challenging. By clearing the session\
    \ history, adversaries aim to obfuscate their operational footprint."
