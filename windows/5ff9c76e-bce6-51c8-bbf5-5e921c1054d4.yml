- description: "This test will use PowerShell to temporarily modify a service to run\
    \ an arbitrary executable by changing its binary path and will then revert the\
    \ binary path change, restoring the service to its original state.\nThis technique\
    \ was previously observed through SnapMC's use of Powerspolit's invoke-serviceabuse\
    \ function. \n[Reference](https://blog.fox-it.com/2021/10/11/snapmc-skips-ransomware-steals-data/)\n"
