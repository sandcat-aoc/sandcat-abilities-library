  name: Delete all auditd rules using auditctl
  description: Using 'auditctl -D' deletes all existing audit rules, resulting in
    the loss of previously configured monitoring settings and the audit trail. This
    action reduces visibility into system activities, potentially leading to compliance
    concerns and hampering security monitoring efforts. Additionally, it poses a risk
    of covering unauthorized activities by erasing evidence from audit logs.
