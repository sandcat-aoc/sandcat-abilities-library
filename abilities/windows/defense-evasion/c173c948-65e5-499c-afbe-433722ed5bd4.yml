  name: Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network
  description: 'Modify the registry to allow a driver, service, to persist in Safe
    Mode with networking.

    see https://redcanary.com/blog/tracking-driver-inventory-to-expose-rootkits/ and
    https://blog.didierstevens.com/2007/03/26/playing-with-safe-mode/ for further
    details.

    Adding a subkey to Netowrk with the name of your service and a default value set
    to Service, makes that your service will be started when you boot into Safe Mode
    with networking.'
