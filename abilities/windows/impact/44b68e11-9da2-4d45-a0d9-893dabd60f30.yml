  name: Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor
  description: DiskCryptor, an open source encryption utility, can be exploited by
    adversaries for encrypting all disk partitions, including system partitions. This
    tool was identified in a ransomware campaign, as reported on https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/.
    The documentation for DiskCryptor can be found at https://github.com/DavidXanatos/DiskCryptor.
    During the installation process, running dcrypt.exe starts the encryption console.
    It's important to note that a system reboot is necessary as part of the installation.
