  name: Make and modify capabilities of a binary
  description: 'Make and modify [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
    of a C source code file.

    The binary doesn''t have to modify the UID, but the binary is given the capability
    to arbitrarily modify it at any time with `setuid(0)`.

    Without being owned by root, the binary can set the UID to 0.'
