  name: Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account
  description: 'PsExec is a powerful tool most known for its remote management capability.
    However, it can also be used to run processes as the local system account.


    The local system account is a default windows account which has unrestricted access
    to all system resources.


    Upon successful execution, PsExec.exe will spawn a command prompt which will run
    ''whoami'' as the local system account and then exit.'
